## The Project Overview  
Indonesia is a country rich in traditional cakes. Different regions have their own traditional cakes. However, there are still many Indonesians and tourists who have difficulty recognizing the names of traditional cakes, let alone the ins and outs. With today's technological advancements, we came up with this idea to make it easier for everyone to recognize traditional cakes by simply pointing their camera at the cake. Information about the traditional cake will come out, from the name to history, even the recipe of it. The existence of Lookies, as an AI mobile app, can be one way to preserve the heritage of the archipelago.  

## The Project Scope  
Each of learning path in this team works collaboratively to deliver the product within the scope below:  
* Develop Lookies as a mobile app to provide information and education about various kinds of Indonesian traditional cake such as the taste, the story behind the cake and the ingredients and this application is aimed for tourists both domestic and abroad.  
* Machine learning team will create a machine learning model to classify the Indonesian traditional cakes utlizing the TensorFlow library for building the Neural Network design (Deep Learning) and using the dataset from Kaggle, Google search, as well as self-captured images of cakes.  
* The Cloud Computing team will set up a cloud service to deploy machine learning model in compute engine and use cloud SQL and cloud storage to store data such as cake and user data.  We also made a rest api application as a data communication.
* The Mobile Development team will create a UI Design for the application and implement it to the android application, then completing the application with API endpoint from Cloud which contains the traditional cakes dataset and ML model that has been trained.  

## Disclaimer
* Lookies might be developed later to be beneficially used for related parties in a collaborative way.  
* Lookies aims to get involved in the business field, such as providing the market e-commerce feature and paid cook-tutoring service in the future development.
